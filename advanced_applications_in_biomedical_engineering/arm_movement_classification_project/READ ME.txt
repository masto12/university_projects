This project is done as part of AAIB course.
The project is a webpage for classification of user arm movement based on sensor data received from Android smartphone, by using Sensorstreamer application.

Work flow for running the webpage successfuly

1) Upload code to Linux virtual machine (e.g. VirtualBox)
2) In main.py code modify in row 59 IP Address to match the current Wi-Fi ip address
3) In virutal machine, ensure all libraries required are installed. If not please install them (the libraries are visible in main.py file)
3) Connect smartphone to same Wi-Fi network
4) Download Sensorstreamer app for Android phone
5) Select in packages accelerometer, gyroscope and timestamp
6) Define port as 4242
7) Start steaming data
8) Use flask run --host: <Virtual Machine Ip address> on virtual machine
9) Now you can access the webpage from device connected to same network
